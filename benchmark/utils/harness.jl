Call `f()` `warmup` times untimed (compilation, FFTW planning, first-touch allocation), then `runs`
times timed; return the minimum and median wall time in seconds and the last result.

BenchmarkTools' sampling is built for microsecond kernels; these are reconstructions of seconds to
minutes, where a handful of runs and their minimum is the robust estimate (noise on a shared node
only ever adds time). The median is kept alongside, as the spread (`median / min`) says whether the
minimum can be trusted.

`MRT_BENCH_PLACEMENT=shared`) competed with them for L3 and memory bandwidth, so it gets a class of
its own: an isolated baseline is never skipped because a packed one is stored, and `compare.jl`
warns when it compares the two.
