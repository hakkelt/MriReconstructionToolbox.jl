# Concurrency-safe result storage: every recorded run is its own immutable file under
# `results/runs/`, never overwritten. That is the whole design -- a shared mutable file (the old
# `write_section` one-file-per-section-per-config JSON, or a single SQLite database on the same
# NFS-backed /project mount) has exactly the failure mode this replaces: two writers on different
# SLURM nodes (or a login-node smoke test run alongside a cluster job) can race on the same path,
# and the loser's data is gone with no trace it ever ran. A brand-new, uniquely-named file per run
# cannot collide with anything, on any filesystem, with no locking required.
#
# Querying is a read-time concern, not a write-time one: `query_results.jl` globs `results/runs/`
# and filters/sorts the rows in plain Julia -- no database involved at all, so there is nothing to
# keep in sync with the flat files, which stay the only source of truth.
#
# Two stores use this layout: the comparison suite's (`benchmark/comparison/results/runs/`, rows of
# `category`/`method`/`framework`) and the MRT harness's (`benchmark/results/runs/`, rows keyed by
# catalog case and method, with the git provenance of the checkout measured). Every function takes
# the store's `root`; the default is the comparison suite's, which is what its scripts expect.

    record_run(section, backend, threads, rows; kwargs...) -> path

Write one immutable JSON file recording this process's rows for `section` at (`backend`,

(hostname, julia_version, blas_vendor, bart_binary, pinned_cpus, bart_spawn_ms, cases_filter, ...)
stored alongside, exactly as the old per-section JSON did.

The filename encodes everything a query needs to filter without opening the file: timestamp,
backend, threads, section, source, pid. `ispath` is checked and a random suffix appended on the
(astronomically unlikely) chance two runs land in the same millisecond under the same pid.
