# Performance

For end users, the main performance recommendations are:

1. Prefer `mul!` over `*` to avoid allocations.
2. Preallocate with `allocate_in_domain(op)` / `allocate_in_codomain(op)`.
3. Use operator constructors with array inputs to preserve storage type (CPU vs GPU).

## Accumulating multiplication

`mul!(y, A, x, α, β)` computes `y = α * (A * x) + β * y`, as for matrices. Use it to add an
operator's output to an array, or to scale it, without a separate pass over `y`:

```julia
mul!(y, A, x, 1, 1)      # y += A * x
mul!(y, A', z, -τ, 1)    # y -= τ * A' * z
mul!(y, A, x, 2, false)  # y = 2 * A * x; the old contents of y are not read
```

`Eye`, `Zeros`, `DiagOp`, `MatrixOp`, `LMatrixOp`, `FiniteDiff`, `HigherOrderDiff`, `GetIndex`
and `ZeroPad`, and their adjoints, compute it in one pass over `y`; `Scale` and `Reshape` pass
`α` and `β` on to the operator they wrap. Any other operator computes `A * x` first and then
combines it with `y`. With `β` zero that needs no memory beyond `y`. Otherwise it needs an array
the size of the codomain, which inside [`with_operator_pool`](@ref) comes from the pool and goes
back to it after the call, and outside a pool is allocated for the call:

```julia
pool = OperatorPool()
with_operator_pool(pool) do
    for k in 1:100
        mul!(y, A, x, 1, 1)  # allocates on the first call only
    end
end
```

```@docs
mul!(::AbstractArray, ::AbstractOperator, ::Any, ::Number, ::Number)
```

Developer-oriented performance internals (threading heuristics, storage traits, backend caveats) were moved to [Custom Operators](@ref) to keep this page concise.
