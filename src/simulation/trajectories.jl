The spokes are dealt into `interleaves` interleaves, spoke `n` to interleave `mod(n, interleaves)`,

not added.)

`nshots` center-out shots of `nsamples` samples each, in `ndims` (2 or 3) dimensions, whose sample

The target density is the isotropic, radially decaying one of Lazarus et al.: `1` up to radius
`cutoff · extent`, then `(cutoff · extent/|k|)^decay`, restricted to the cube `|k|∞ < extent`.

Each iteration takes a gradient step on the SPARKLING energy — attraction to the target minus
repulsion between samples, both with the kernel `|x - y|` — and projects every shot back onto the
constraints: it starts on `k = 0`, moves at most `max_step` between samples (gradient amplitude),
and its step changes by at most `max_curvature` between samples (slew rate), all in the normalized
units of the trajectory. The gradient comes from a particle-mesh evaluation on a `grid_size^ndims`
grid (the two densities are deposited by cloud-in-cell and convolved with the kernel's gradient by
FFT), so an iteration costs `O(nshots · nsamples + grid_size^ndims log grid_size)`. The projection
is a constrained tracking pass along each shot, which keeps every iterate feasible but is not the
exact Euclidean projection of the paper. The result is deterministic.
