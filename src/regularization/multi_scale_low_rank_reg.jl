	MultiScaleLowRank(λ; block_sizes, time_dim=nothing, weights=nothing, shift=:none, rng=Random.default_rng())

Create a multi-scale locally low-rank regularization term: the same block-wise nuclear norm as
[`LocallyLowRank`](@ref), but evaluated over several block sizes at once so that both fine, localized
dynamics and large, globally correlated dynamics are penalized by the same term.

# Arguments
- `λ`: Regularization parameter: a scalar (the same threshold at every scale) or a vector with one
  entry per scale (`block_sizes`). `λ` and `weights` are not interchangeable: `λⱼ` is the nuclear-norm
  threshold *of* scale `j`'s block-decomposed term, while `weights` is the convex combination the
  proximal average takes *across* scales (see Notes) -- scaling one does not have the same effect as
  scaling the other. Use a per-scale `λ` to give coarse/fine scales different thresholds directly;
  use `weights` to bias the average toward one scale while keeping every scale's own threshold equal.
- `block_sizes`: Collection of block edge lengths, one entry per scale. Each entry is either an `Integer`
  (same edge in every spatial dimension) or a tuple with one entry per spatial dimension. A geometric
  progression such as `(4, 8, 16)` is the usual choice.
- `time_dim`: (optional) Dimension holding the frames / contrasts, as for [`LocallyLowRank`](@ref).
- `weights`: (optional) Convex weights of the scales; defaults to uniform. Must be non-negative and sum to 1.
- `shift`, `rng`: (optional) Grid-shift policy, as for [`LocallyLowRank`](@ref). Applied to every scale.

# Notes
- Multi-scale low-rank modelling of dynamic images was introduced by Ong & Lustig, *Beyond low rank + sparse:
  Multiscale low rank matrix decomposition*, IEEE J Sel Top Signal Process 2016, and is available in BART as
  `-R M`. Their formulation decomposes the image into one *separate component per scale*
  (`x = ∑_j x_j`, each `x_j` penalized at its own block size), which is an exact model with an exact prox per
  component; that formulation is expressible directly with this package's image decomposition — one
  [`Component`](@ref) per scale, each carrying a [`LocallyLowRank`](@ref) — and is the better choice when the
  separated components are themselves of interest.
- This term instead penalizes a *single* image at several scales at once, which has no closed-form proximal
  operator, so it uses the proximal average of the per-scale block nuclear norms (see
  [`ProximalAverage`](@ref)). This is an approximation of the sum of the per-scale penalties, not the sum
  itself: the reported objective value is the weighted average of the per-scale penalties and the minimizer
  is that of the proximal average. Prefer it when one regularized image (not a decomposition) is wanted.
- With a single entry in `block_sizes` and weight 1, the term reduces exactly to [`LocallyLowRank`](@ref).
- Cost is the sum of the per-scale costs: one SVD per block per scale and iteration.
